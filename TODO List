GOAL:
Produce a full pipeline of C/CPP code to colored graph representing the registers needed to execute it via some model that we train 
 - test efficacy of different models in this task 


Broad TODO List:
1. find dataset of C/CPP code to feed into Model of some description and into the interference graph generator 
2. make interference graph generator, ie a colored graph generator 
3. mess around with LLVM to examine efficacy against heuristics and model outputs 
  3.1. if we find a GNN that doesn't require a cromatic number then thats also cool but not necessary for the project
4. decide on a model to use for this project, ie LSTM
   

Fine TODO List:
1. examine our current datasets and see if they can be combined in some way
