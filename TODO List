TODO List:
1. find dataset of C/CPP code to feed into Model of some discription 
2. make inference graph generator 
3. mess around with LSTMs to examine efficacy
  3.1. if we find a GNN that doesnt require a cromatic number then thats also cool but not necessary for the project
4. decide on a model to use for this project
